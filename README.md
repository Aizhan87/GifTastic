I created an app that renders gifs from Giphy API to the page. When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.
